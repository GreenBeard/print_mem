This program prints the memory at a user specified physical address. It only
prints a single byte a time, however, this could easily be changed by modifying
the function to handle data the crossed page boundaries, and larger chunks of
memory. I was inspired by the question of a friend on how to print memory. At
first I thought of just printing a char* address with a program using sudo. I
quickly before even finishing this though that virtual memory is used on all
modern operating systems. It was an interesting learning experience to make
this simple program.

I am also aware that having what is effectively a unit test in the main() is
poor form. However, this project is not large enough to deserve the necessary
overhead of setting up proper unit tests.

WARNING: THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN WITHOUT A KERNEL MODIFICATION ON RECENT
VERSIONS OF LINUX. An already existant modification that can be found at
https://github.com/ozgunawesome/devmem-full-access although it is a very
simple modification that can be installed at runtime with the insmod command.

Additionally, it should hopefully go without saying this program requires sudo,
or root access in order to function properly.
